# telnetd_ramdisk
This is beta because it's morning and I have to go to bed now and write the README later. But THANKS to anybody that made this possible through their tools and research and it fucking works now. I'm so goddamn happy :)

Sample usage: `./make_telnet_rd.php iPhone10,5 D211AP 13.5 /Users/daniel/Documents/dualbootfun/4905935052021678_iPhone10\,5_d211ap_13.7-17H35_27325c8258be46e69d9ee57fa9a8fbc28b873df434e5e702a8b27999551138ae.shsh2`

it tells you everything you need to know and do to get the ramdisk and telnet connection up and running, and it's basically nothing :D
